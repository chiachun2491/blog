螢幕輸入 First line is N, denotes the amount of test case, then there are Ns graph data followed by N. Second line is V, each graph data is composed of V (the number of vertices, &amp;lt;= 1000). Third line is E, the number of edges, it does no size limitation, then followed by Es edges which are denoted by pair of vertex (e.</description></item></channel></rss>
